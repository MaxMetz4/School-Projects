        <main>
            <section><h4>Who Am I?</h4>I pledge my honor that I have... oh wait we don't have to do that for this. Anyway, my name 
                    is Max Metzner and I'm a freshman in your CS 146 class. Unfortunately I have a 
                    windows machine, but I've made it this far, right?</section>
            <section><h4>Where Am I from?</h4>I grew up in California in a 
                    town called Simi Valley, just north of Los Angeles. 2 Years ago I moved to 
                    Syosset, New Jersey, where I completed high school. I love to play volleyball 
                    and have played 3 years of club volleyball in high school (hopefully I can make 
                    the school team here at Stevens). Now that I'm in Stevens I am looking forward 
                    to a lot of learning. :) </section>
