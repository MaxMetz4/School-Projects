            The major concepts of this exercise were:

            Making data-centered HTML Documents
            Thinking in terms of describing our data, without care for the visual aspect
            Focusing on structure and semantical validity.
            Writing valid HTML
            Your HTML must be valid (Links to an external site.) 
            Linking between pages
            You will use a basic navigation structure (see below) on each page to link to all the pages you are writing.
            </p>

                I did so well on that assignment, the teacher even decided to get rid of my lowest quiz grade
